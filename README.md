# Status Assertions Scopes

Status Assertions are used to provide evidences about the validity of Digital Credentials, such as the non revocation of these, according to the mechanism where all the information are provided by Wallet and under the sole control of the User. Using the Status Assertions the Credential Verifiers without introducing third parties, the Credential Verifiers do not ask information about a Credential outside of the Wallet instance. Status Assertions are issued on request of the Credential holder who can present them to the Verifiers together with the corresponding Digital Credentials.

## Issuance and Presentation of Status Assertions

1) **Generation:** A Credential Issuer generates a Status Assertion that provides a signed proof of the current status of a Credential.
2) **Request and receipt:** The Holder can request a Status Assertion from the Credential Issuer. This is usually done by means of a request containing a JSON Web Token (JWT) or a CBOR Web Token (CWT) that carries a proof of possession of the Credential.
3) **Presentation:** The Holder presents the Credential together with its Status Assertion to the Verifier. This process is similar to Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) stapling in the TLS protocol, where the server presents a time-stamped status token.

## Features

**Data protection:** The procedure ensures that no unnecessary personal data of the Holder or information about the use of the Credential is passed on to the Verifier or other parties. Verifiers do not need direct interaction with the Credential Issuer or other third parties to confirm the status of a Digital Credential.
**Offline capability:** The ability to check the validity of credentials offline without having to access a central database or online status lists is a key advantage of this approach.
