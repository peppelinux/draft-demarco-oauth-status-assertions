--- abstract

Status Assertion is a signed object that demonstrates the validity status of a
Digital Credential.
These assertions are periodically provided
to Holders, who can present these to Credential Verifier along
with the corresponding Digital Credentials.
The approach outlined in this document
makes the Credential Verifier able to check the status,
such as the non-revocation, of a Digital Credential
without requiring to query any third-party entities.

# Introduction

Status Assertions show the status of Digital
Credentials, whether in JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or CBOR Web Tokens (CWT)
format. Status Assertions function
similarly to OCSP Stapling ([RFC6066]), allowing Holders
to present to the Relying Parties
time-stamped assertions provided by the Issuer.
The approach outlined in this specification enables the
verification of Digital Credentials against revocation without
direct queries to third-party systems,
enhancing privacy, reducing latency, and
faciliting offline verification.

The figure below illustrates the process by which a Holder,
such as a wallet instance,
requests and obtains a Status Assertion from the Issuer.

**Figure 2**: Status Assertion Presentation Flow.

In summary, the Issuer provides the Holder with a
Status Assertion, which is linked to a Digital Credential. This enables
the Holder to present both the Digital Credential and its
Status Assertion to a Credential Verifier as proof of the Digital Credential's
validity status.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}


# Terminology

This specification uses the terms "End-User", "Entity" as defined by
OpenID Connect Core [OpenID.Core], the term "JSON Web Token (JWT)"
defined by JSON Web Token (JWT) {{RFC7519}},
the term "CBOR Web Token (CWT)" defined in {{RFC8392}}, "Client" as
defined {{RFC6749}}, "Holder", "Verifiable Presentation"
defined in [OpenID4VP].

Digital Credential:
: A set of one or more claims about a subject issued by an Issuer.
Alternative names are "Verifiable Credential" or "Credential".

Issuer:
: Entity that is responsible for the issuance of the Digital Credentials.
The Issuer is responsible for the lifecycle of their issued
Digital Credentials and their validity status and responsible for issuance
of related Status Assertions. Alternative name is "Credential Issuer".

Verifier:
: Entity that relies on the validity of the Digital Credentials presented to it.
This Entity, verifies the authenticity and
validity of the Digital Credentials, including their revocation status,
before accepting them. Alternative names are
"Relying Party" and "Credential Verifier".

Wallet Instance:
: The digital Wallet in control of a User, also known as Wallet.
It securely stores the User's Digital Credentials. It can present
Digital Credentials to Verifiers
and request Status Assertions from Issuers under the control of the User.
For the purposes of this specification, the Wallet Instance is
considered as a Client.

# Rationale

There are cases where the Verifier only needs
to check the revocation status of a Digital Credential at the time of
presentation, and therefore it should not be allowed to
check the status of a Digital Credential over time due to some
privacy constraints, in compliance with national privacy regulations.

For instance, consider a scenario where a Verifier's repeated access to a
status list, such as the one defined in
[draft-ietf-oauth-status-list]
to check the revocation status of a Digital Credential could
be deemed as excessive monitoring of the End-User's activities.

This could potentially infringe upon the End-User's right to privacy,
as outlined in
[ECHR-ART8] and
in the the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation
[GDPR],
by creating a detailed profile of the End-User's
Digital Credential status without explicit consent for
such continuous surveillance.

# Requirements

The general requirements for the implementation of Status Assertion are
listed in this section. The Status Assertion:

- notifies the Holder about the status of their Digital Credential,
because the Holder MUST be informed by the Issuers of any changes
in the status of their Digital Credentials.
- SHOULD be presented in conjunction with the Digital Credential.
- MUST include information that links it to the
referenced Digital Credential.
- MUST be timestamped with its issuance datetime,
using a timestamp which is at or after the time of
Digital Credential issuance which it refers.
- MUST contain the expiration datetime after which
the Status Assertion MUST NOT be considered valid anymore,
and the Digital Credential referred to SHOULD NOT
be considered as having a valid status, unless there exists some specific Verifier policy that provides stronger guidance.
The expiration datetime MUST be
superior to the Status Assertion issuance datetime and it MUST end before
the expiration datetime of the Digital Credential.
- MAY contain the _not before time_ parameter, specifying the time
from which the Status Assertion MUST be considered valid and evaluable.
- MUST enable the offline use cases by employing validation using
a cryptographic signature and the cryptographic public key of the
Issuer.
- SHOULD NOT contain personal information about the User, that isn't already made available to the Verifier, who owns
the Digital Credential to which the Status Assertion refers.
- MUST NOT contain any information regarding the Verifier to whom it may
be presented, such as disclose the Verifier identifier to specify the intended audience.

# Proof of Possession of a Digital Credential

The concept of Proof of Possession (PoP) of a Digital Credential within the
framework of the Status Assertion specification encompasses a broader
perspective than merely possessing the digital bytes of the Digital Credential.

It involves demonstrating rightful control or ownership over the
Digital Credential, which can manifest in various forms depending on the
technology employed and the nature of the Digital Credential itself.
For instance, a Digital Credential could be presented visually (de-visu)
with a personal portrait serving as a binding element.

While this specification does not prescribe any additional methods
for the proof of possession of the Digital Credential, it aims to offer
guidance for concrete implementations utilizing common proof of
possession mechanisms. This includes, but is not limited to:

1. Having the digital representation of the Digital Credential (the bytes).
2. Controlling the confirmation method of the Digital Credential,
using the Digital Credential's `cnf` claim.

The essence of requiring proof of possession over the Digital Credential
through the confirmation method, such has proving the control of the
cryptographic material related to a Digital Credential, is
to ensure that the entity in possession of the Digital Credential can execute
actions exclusively reserved to the legitimate Holder.
The dual-layered approach of requiring both possession of the
Digital Credential and control over it, reinforces the security and integrity
of the Status Assertion process.
This ensures that the Holder requesting a Status Assertion is indeed
the same Holder to which the Digital Credential was originally issued,
affirming the authenticity and rightful possession of the Digital Credential.

# Status Assertion Request

The following diagram shows the Wallet Instance requesting a
Status Assertion to an Issuer,
related to a specific Digital Credential issued by the same Issuer.

~~~

The Wallet Instance sends the Status Assertion request to the
Issuer, where:

- The request MUST contain the base64url encoded hash value of the Digital Credential's
Issuer signed part, such as the Issuer Signed JWT using [SD-JWT.VC],
or the Mobile Security Object using [ISO.mdoc],
for which the Status Assertion is requested, and enveloped in a signed
Status Assertion Request object.
- The Status Assertion Request object MUST be signed with the private key corresponding
to the confirmation claim assigned by the Issuer and contained within
the Digital Credential.

The Status Assertion Request object MUST contain the parameters and claims defined
in the following table.

| Header | Description | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **typ** | It MUST be set to `status-assertion-request+jwt` when JWT format is used. It MUST be set to `status-assertion-request+cwt` when CWT format is used. | {{RFC7516}} Section 4.1.1, [RFC9596] |
| **alg** | A digital signature algorithm identifier such as per IANA "JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms" registry. It MUST NOT be set to `none` or any symmetric algorithm (MAC) identifier. | {{RFC7516}} Section 4.1.1 |

Below is a non-normative example of a Status Assertion Request with
the JWT headers and payload represented without applying signature and
encoding:

    "typ": "status-assertion-request+jwt"
}

    "credential_hash_alg": "sha-256"
}
~~~

Below is a non-normative example of a Status Assertion Request object in CWT format
represented in CBOR diagnostic notation format {{RFC8152}}, where the CWT headers
and payload are presented without applying signature and encoding for better readability:

~~~
   [
       / protected / << {
       / alg / 1: -7 / ES256 /
       / typ / 16: -7 / status-assertion-request+cwt /
     } >>,

       / credential_hash_alg / 9: sha-256 /
     } >>,
   ]
~~~

Below a non-normative example representing a Status Assertion Request array with a
single Status Assertion Request object in JWT format.

~~~
POST /status-assertion-endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: issuer.example.org
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "status_assertion_requests" : [
      $status_assertion_request,
      $status_assertion_request, ...
    ]
}
~~~

The Status Assertion HTTP request can be sent to a single Issuer
regarding multiple Digital Credentials, and MUST contain a JSON object with
the member `status_assertion_requests`.

The `status_assertion_requests` MUST be set with an array of strings, where
each string within the array represents a Digital Credential
Status Assertion Request object.

The Issuer that receives the Status Assertion Request object
MUST validate that the Wallet Instance making the request is
authorized to request Status Assertions.
Therefore the following requirements MUST be satisfied:

- The Issuer MUST verify the compliance of all elements in the `status_assertion_requests` object
using the confirmation method contained within the Digital Credential where the Status Assertion Request
object is referred to;
- The Issuer MUST verify that it is the legitimate Issuer of the Digital Credential
to which each Status Assertion Request object refers.


# Status Assertion Response

The response MUST include a JSON object with a member
named `status_assertion_responses`, which contains the
Status Assertions and or the Status Assertion Errors
related to the request made by the
Wallet Instance. In the non-normative example below is
represented an HTTP Response with the
`status_assertion_responses` JSON member:

~~~
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "status_assertion_responses": [
      $status_assertion_response,
      $status_assertion_response, ...
    ]
}
~~~

The member `status_assertion_responses` MUST be an array of strings,
where each of them represent a Status Assertion Response object,
as defined in
[the section Status Assertion](#status-assertion) or a Status Assertion Error object,
as defined in [the section Status Error](#status-assertion-error).

For each entry in the `status_assertion_responses` array, the following requirements are met:

- Each element in the array MUST match the corresponding element in the request array at
the same position index to which it is related, eg: _\[requestAboutA, requestAboutB\]_ may produce _\[responseAboutA, responseErrorAboutB\]_.
- Each element MUST contain the error or the status of the assertion, using the `typ` member
set to "status-assertion+{jwt,cwt}" or "status-assertion-error+{jwt,cwt}", depending by the object type.
- The corresponding entry in the response MUST be of the same data format as requested. For example,
if the entry in the request is "jwt", then the entry at the same position in the response MUST also be "jwt".
- The corresponding entry in the response MUST NOT contain any
information regarding the Verifier to whom it may be presented,
such as the Verifier identifier as the intended audience.

# Status Assertion Error

The Status Assertion Error MUST NOT be presented or provided to a Verifier,
the only audience of the Status Assertion Error is the Holder of the Digital Credential
that has requested the Status Assertion. Therefore,
it is not necessary that the Status Assertion Error
contains the claim `aud`; if present, it MUST be set to the same
value as the `iss` claim used by the Wallet in the corresponding
Status Assertion Request object.

Below a non-normative example of a Status Assertion Error object in JWT format,
with the headers and payload represented in JSON and without applying the signature.

~~~
{
    "alg": "ES256",
    "typ": "status-assertion-error+jwt",
    "kid": "Issuer-JWK-KID"
}
.
{
    "iss": "https://issuer.example.org",
    "jti": "6f204f7e-e453-4dfd-814e-9d155319408c"
    "credential_hash": $hash-about-Issuer-Signed-JWT,
    "credential_hash_alg": "sha-256",
    "error": "invalid_request_signature",
    "error_description": "The verification of the request signature has failed."
    }
}
~~~

The Status Assertion Error object MUST contain the parameters and claims described in the
table below:

| Header | Description | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **typ** | REQUIRED. Depending on the related Status Assertion Request object format, it MUST be set to `status-assertion-error+jwt` or `status-assertion-error+cwt`. | {{RFC7516}} Section 4.1.1 |
| **alg** | REQUIRED. Algorithm used to verify the cryptographic signature of the Status Assertion Error. Status Assertion Error that do not need to be signed SHOULD set the `alg` value to `none`. For further clarification about the requirement of signing the Status Assertion Errors, see Section [Rationale About The Unsigned Status Assertion Errors](#rationale-about-the-unsigned-status-assertion-errors). | {{RFC7516}} Section 4.1.1 |

| Payload | Description | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **iss** | REQUIRED. It MUST be set to the identifier of the Issuer. | {{RFC9126}}, {{RFC7519}} |
| **jti** | REQUIRED. Unique identifier for the JWT.  | {{RFC7519}} Section 4.1.7 |
| **credential_hash** | REQUIRED. The hash value MUST match the one contained in the Status Assertion Request to which the Status Assertion Error is related. | this specification |
| **credential_hash_alg** |  REQUIRED. The hash algorithm MUST match the one contained in the Status Assertion Request to which the Status Assertion Error is related. | this specification |
| **error** | REQUIRED. The value SHOULD be assigned with one of the error types defined in {{RFC6749}}[Section 5.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-5.2) or defined in the Section [Status Assertion Error Values](status-assertion-error-values). | {{RFC7519}} Section 4.1.7 |
| **error_description** | OPTIONAL. Text that clarifies the nature of the error in relation to the `error` value.  | {{RFC7519}} Section 4.1.7 |

## Rationale about the Unsigned Status Assertion Errors

To mitigate potential resource exhaustion attacks where an adversary could issue hundreds of fake Status Assertion Requests to force an Issuer to sign numerous Status Assertion Errors, it is advisable to set the header parameter `alg` value to `none` for Status Assertion Errors that do not require signatures. This approach conserves computational resources and prevents abuse, especially in scenarios where the Issuer's implementation could be vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks. However, even if it is out of the scopes of this specification determine in which the Status Error Assertion signatures are necessary, when the Issuer signs the Status Assertion Errors the Holder that received them MUST validate the signature.

## Status Assertion Error Values

The `error` claim for the Status Assertion Error object MUST be set with one of the values defined in the table below, in addition to the values specified in {{RFC6749}}:

| Error Value | Description | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **invalid_request_signature** | The Status Assertion Request signature validation has failed. This error type is used when the proof of possession of the Digital Credential is found not valid within the Status Assertion Request. | this specification |
| **credential_not_found** | The `credential_hash` value provided in the Status Assertion Request doesn't match with any active Digital Credential. | this specification |
| **unsupported_hash_alg** | The hash algorithm set in `credential_hash_alg` is not supported. | this specification |

# Status Assertion

When a Status Assertion is requested to an Issuer, the
Issuer checks the status of the Digital Credential and creates a
Status Assertion bound to it.

A non-normative example is given below
where the format is JWT.

~~~
{
    "alg": "ES256",
    "typ": "status-assertion+jwt",
    "kid": $ISSUER-JWKID
}
.
{
    "iss": "https://issuer.example.org",
    "iat": 1504699136,
    "exp": 1504785536,
    "credential_hash": $hash-about-Issuer-Signed-JWT,
    "credential_hash_alg": "sha-256",
    "credential_status_type": 0,
    "cnf": {
        "jwk": {...}
    }
}
~~~

The Status Assertion MUST contain the parameters and claims defined below.

| Header Parameter Name | Description | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **alg** | A digital signature algorithm identifier such as per IANA "JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms" registry. It MUST NOT be set to `none` or to a symmetric algorithm (MAC) identifier. | {{RFC7515}}, {{RFC7517}} |
| **typ** | It MUST be set to `status-assertion+jwt` when JWT format is used. It MUST be set to `status-assertion+cwt` when CWT format is used. | {{RFC7515}}, {{RFC7517}} and this specification |
| **kid** | Unique identifier of the Issuer JWK. It is required when `x5c` or other cryptographic public key resolution identifiers are not used. | {{RFC7515}} |
| **x5c** | X.509 certificate chain about the Issuer. It is required when `kid` or other parameter are not used. | {{RFC7515}} |

| Payload Claim Name | Description | Reference |

# Interoperability of Issuers Supporting Status Assertions

This section outlines how Issuers support Status Assertions,
detailing the necessary metadata and practices to integrate into their systems.

## Issuer Metadata

Issuers using Status Assertions include in their
metadata the following values:

- `status_assertion_endpoint`. REQUIRED. It MUST be an HTTPs URL indicating
the endpoint where the Wallet Instances can request Status Assertions.
- `credential_hash_alg_supported`. REQUIRED. The supported algorithm used by
the Wallet Instance to hash the Digital Credential's Issuer signed part for which the
Status Assertion is requested,  using one of the hash algorithms listed
in the [IANA-HASH-REG].
- `credential_status_type_supported`. OPTIONAL. Digital Credential status type supported by the Issuer as a JSON array.
- `credential_status_detail_supported`. OPTIONAL. JSON array that outlines the details of each Digital Credential's validity status supported by the Credential Issuer. This metadata MAY be used to extend the values defined in Section [Status Assertion](#status-assertion). Each entry MUST contain the following values:

    - `state`. String value of a Digital Credential status supported.
    - `description`. String containing the human-readable description of the status related to this object.

## Issued Digital Credentials

The Issuers that uses the Status Assertions SHOULD include in the
issued Digital Credentials the object `status` with the
JSON member `status_assertion` set to a JSON Object containing the following
member:

- `credential_hash_alg`. REQUIRED. The algorithm used of hashing the
Digital Credential's Issuer signed part to which the Status Assertion is bound, using one of the
hash algorithms listed in the [IANA-HASH-REG].
Among the hash algorithms, `sha-256` is recommended and
SHOULD be implemented by all systems.


The non-normative example of an unsecured payload of
an [SD-JWT.VC] is shown below.

~~~
{
 "vct": "https://credentials.example.com/identity_credential",
 "given_name": "John",
 "family_name": "Doe",
 "email": "johndoe@example.com",
 "phone_number": "+1-202-555-0101",
 "address": {
   "street_address": "123 Main St",
   "locality": "Anytown",
   "region": "Anystate",
   "country": "US"
 },
 "birthdate": "1940-01-01",
 "is_over_18": true,
 "is_over_21": true,
 "is_over_65": true,
 "status": {
    "status_assertion": {
        "credential_hash_alg": "sha-256",
    }
 }
}
~~~

### Issuer Implementation Considerations

When the Digital Credential is issued, the Issuer should
calculate the hash value of the Digital Credential's Issuer signed part using the algorithm specified in
`status.status_assertion.credential_hash_alg` and store this information
in its database. This practice enhances efficiency by allowing the
Issuer to quickly compare the requested
`credential_hash` with the pre-calculated one, when processing
Status Assertion requests made by Holders.

# Presenting Status Assertions

The Wallet Instance that provides the Status Assertions using [OpenID4VP], SHOULD include in the
`vp_token` JSON array, as defined in [OpenID4VP], the Status Assertion along with the
related Digital Credential.

The Verifier that receives a Digital Credential supporting the Status Assertion,
SHOULD:

- Decode and validate the Digital Credential;
- Check the presence of `status.status_assertion` in the
Digital Credential. If true, the Verifier SHOULD:
  - produce the hash of the Digital Credential's Issuer signed part using the
  hashing algorithm configured in `status.status_assertion.credential_hash_alg`;
  - decode all the Status Assertions provided in the presentation,
  by matching the JWS Header parameter `typ` set to `status-assertion+jwt`
  and looking for the `credential_hash` value that matches with the
  hash produced at the previous point;
  - evaluate the validity of the Status Assertion within the `vp_token` parameter, by checking the following items:
    - the Issuer claim value MUST match the one in the Digital Credential;
    - the Issued at time claim value MUST be equal to or later than the Issued at time claim value in the Digital Credential;
    - the Expiration time claim value MUST be later than the current time;
    - the Not before time claim value, if present, MUST be less than or equal to the current time;
    - the confirmation method MUST be used for the validation (eg: if it uses cryptographic material, this material must be used for the signature validation);
    - the hash of the Digital Credential MUST be produced as described in [Section 7](#status-assertion-request) and MUST match the hash contained in the Status Assertion.

# Considerations on Revocation Verification

The recommendation for Verifiers to check the revocation status
of Digital Credentials as a 'SHOULD' instead of a 'MUST' acknowledges
that the decision to verify revocation is not absolute and may be
influenced by various factors. Consider as an example the case of age-over x;
even if it has expired, it may still perform its intended purpose.
As a result, the expiration status alone does not render it invalid.
The adaptability recognizes that the need to verify revocation status
may not always coincide with the actual usability of a Digital Credential,
allowing Verifiers to examine and make educated conclusions based on a
variety of scenarios.

# Detailed Status Assertions

Status Assertions can introduce a more accurate level of detail about the Digital Credential status.
This enables Verifier policies to be conditioned on the presence of authorative information.
This section proposes syntax to support detailed assertions.
The `credential_status_type` claim MUST be present.
The `credential_status_detail` claim MAY be present and if present MUST be an object.
The semantics of the claims within the `credential_status_detail` object are determined by the Issuer.

An example of an enumeration detail status is:

~~~
{
    "alg": "ES256",
    "typ": "status-assertion+jwt",
    "kid": "w8ZOZRcx21Zpry7H-0VLBsH7Wf7WXb6TeK3qVMCpY44"
}
.
{
    "iss": "https://issuer.example.org",
    "iat": 1504699136,
    "exp": 1504785536,
    "credential_hash": "xnlAq6Ma8fgu1z4hdGphJnKLulaVHpLCFeZFUGpQ2dA",
    "credential_hash_alg": "sha-256",
    "credential_status_type": 3,
    "credential_status_detail": {
      ...
    },
    "cnf": {
      "jwk": {
        "alg": "ES256",
        "kty": "EC",
        "crv": "P-256",
        "x": "_2ySUmWFjwmraNlo15r6dIBXerVdy_NpJuwAKJMFdoc",
        "y": "MV3C88MhhEMba6oyMBWuGeB3dKHP4YADJmGyJwwILsk"
      }
    }
}
~~~

An example of dynamic status using a small matrix for detail status:

~~~
{
    "alg": "ES256",
    "typ": "status-assertion+jwt",
    "kid": "w8ZOZRcx21Zpry7H-0VLBsH7Wf7WXb6TeK3qVMCpY44"
}
.
{
    "iss": "https://issuer.example.org",
    "iat": 1504699136,
    "exp": 1504785536,
    "credential_hash": "xnlAq6Ma8fgu1z4hdGphJnKLulaVHpLCFeZFUGpQ2dA",
    "credential_hash_alg": "sha-256",
    "credential_status_type": 0,
    "credential_status_detail": {
      "preferences": [[1, 0.25, 0.76 ...] ...]
    },
    "cnf": {
      "jwk": {
        "alg": "ES256",
        "kty": "EC",
        "crv": "P-256",
        "x": "_2ySUmWFjwmraNlo15r6dIBXerVdy_NpJuwAKJMFdoc",
        "y": "MV3C88MhhEMba6oyMBWuGeB3dKHP4YADJmGyJwwILsk"
      }
    }
}
~~~

An example of multiple assertions:

~~~
HTTP/1.1 200 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "status_assertion_responses": [
      $JWT_1, // valid, boolean assertion
      $JWT_2, // alg = none, suspended indicator
      $JWT_3, // Preferences matrix assertion
    ]
}
~~~

# Security Considerations

TODO Security

# Privacy Considerations

In the design and implementation of Status Assertions, particular
attention has been paid to privacy considerations to ensure that the
system is respectful of user privacy and compliant with relevant
regulations.

## Privacy Consideration: Status Assertion Request Opacity

The request for a Status Assertion does not transmit the Digital Credential
for which the status is being attested. Instead, it includes a proof of
possession (PoP) of the Digital Credential that is only interpretable by the
Issuer who issued the Digital Credential for which the
Status Assertion is requested. This PoP can be achieved through a
cryptographic signature using the public key contained within the
Digital Credential over the request. This method is essential for
preventing the potential for fraudulent requests intended to mislead or
disclose sensitive information to unintended parties. By separating the
Digital Credential from the Status Assertion Request, the system ensures
that the request does not inadvertently disclose any information about
the Digital Credential or its Holder. This strategy significantly
enhances the privacy and security of the system by preventing the
assertion process from being used to collect information about
Digital Credentials or their Holders through deceptive requests.

## Privacy Consideration: Opacity of Status Assertion Content

An important privacy consideration is how the Status Assertion is
structured to ensure it does not reveal any information about the User or
the Holder of the Digital Credential. The Status Assertion is crafted
to prove only the vital information needed to verify the current state
of a Digital Credential, moving beyond simple revocation or
suspension checks. This is done by focusing the assertion content on the
Digital Credential's present condition and the method for its
verification, rather than on the identity of the Digital Credential's
Holder. This approach is key in keeping the User's anonymity intact,
making sure that the Status Assertion can be applied in various
verification situations without risking the privacy of the people involved.

## Unlinkability and Reusability of Status Assertions

Status Assertions are designed to uphold privacy by allowing Verifiers
to operate independently, without the need for interaction or information
disclosure to third-party entities or other Verifiers. This design is
pivotal in ensuring unlinkability between Verifiers, where actions
taken by one Verifier cannot be correlated or linked to actions
taken by another. Verifiers can directly validate the status of a
Digital Credential through the Status Assertion, eliminating the need
for external communication. This mechanism is key in protecting the
privacy of individuals whose Digital Credentials are being verified, as
it significantly reduces the risk of tracking or profiling based on
verification activities across various services.

While Status Assertions facilitate unlinkability, they are not inherently
"single use." The specification accommodates the batch issuance of multiple
Status Assertions, which can be single-use. However, particularly for
offline interactions, a Single Assertion may be utilized by numerous
Verifiers. This flexibility ensures that Status Assertions can support
a wide range of verification scenarios, from one-time validations to
repeated checks by different entities, without compromising the privacy
or security of the Digital Credential Holder.

## Untrackability by Digital Credential Issuers and the "Phone Home" Problem

A fundamental aspect of the privacy-preserving attributes of
Status Assertions is their ability to address the "phone home" problem,
which is the prevention of tracking by Digital Credential Issuers.
Traditional models often require Verifiers to query a central status
list or contact the Issuer directly, a process that can inadvertently
allow Issuers to track when and where a Digital Credential
is verified. Status Assertions, however, encapsulate all necessary
verification information within the assertion itself. This design choice
ensures that Issuers are unable to monitor the verification
activities of their issued Digital Credentials, thereby significantly
enhancing the privacy of the Holder. By removing the need for real-time
communication with the Issuer for status checks, Status Assertions
effectively prevent the Issuer from tracking verification activities,
further reinforcing the system's dedication to protecting User privacy.

## Minimization of Data Exposure

The Status Assertions are designed around the data minimization principle.
Data minimization ensures that only the necessary information required
for the scope of attesting the non revocation status of the Digital
Credential. This minimizes the exposure of potentially sensitive data.

## Resistance to Enumeration Attacks

The design of Status Assertions incorporates measures to resist
enumeration attacks, where an adversary attempts to gather information
by systematically verifying different combinations of data.
By implementing robust cryptographic techniques and limiting the
information contained in Status Assertions, the system reduces the
feasibility of such attacks. This consideration is vital for safeguarding
the privacy of the Holders and for ensuring the integrity of
the verification process.

Status Assertions are based on a privacy-by-design approach, reflecting
a deliberate effort to balance security and privacy needs in the
Digital Credential ecosystem.

## Validity Reasons

Depending by the scopes of how the detailed Status Assertions are implemented, these may disclose details about the Holder or subject that were not initially committed to during the original Digital Credential issuance. This can potentially expose additional information that was not part of the original credentialing process.
Providing a reason that a Digital Credential is no longer valid can be essential to certain use cases, and unacceptable for others.
For example, in a healthcare setting, a patient should not have medical reasons for a suspended Digital Credential disclosed in assertions of suspension.
However, in a supply chain context, a product suspension might benefit from additional information, such as batch or lot information.
